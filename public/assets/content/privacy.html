  <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium text-tech">3. Cookies and similar technologies</h2>

  <p>
    We use cookies, local storage, and similar technologies to provide basic functionality and to
    collect analytics data. Cookies may be:
  </p>

  <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
    <li>
      <strong>Essential cookies:</strong>
      required for site functionality (e.g., session management).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Performance/analytics cookies:</strong>
      used to measure and analyze how our site is used so we can improve its performance and
      content.
    </li>
    <li>

  </p>

  <hr class="my-6 border-gray-200" />

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium text-tech">4. Analytics and third-party services</h2>

  <p>
    We use third-party providers to support our infrastructure and analytics. Typical providers
    include content delivery networks (CDNs), analytics services, email delivery platforms, and code
    hosting services. Examples include Cloudflare (CDN, DNS, security) and GitHub (code hosting /
    CI). These providers may receive limited technical information necessary to operate the service.
  </p>

  <p>
    When we use analytics services (for example Cloudflare Insights or Google Analytics), data is
    typically aggregated and anonymized. We configure analytics to minimize personal data retention
    where possible and to respect users’ privacy preferences.
  </p>

  <hr class="my-6 border-gray-200" />

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium text-tech">5. Affiliate relationships and sponsored content</h2>

  <p>
    Calmiqs may participate in affiliate programs and may display affiliate links to products or
    services we recommend. If you click an affiliate link and make a purchase, we may earn a
    commission at no additional cost to you.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our affiliate relationships do not influence editorial independence. All recommendations are
    based on our assessment of value, quality, and fit for our audience. Affiliate links are
    disclosed clearly when present.

  </p>

  <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">

      With service providers who perform functions on our behalf (hosting, analytics, email
      delivery), under contractual obligations to protect privacy and limit use.
    </li>
    <li>
      When required by law, court order, or to respond to lawful requests by public authorities.
    </li>
    <li>
      To protect the rights, property, or safety of Calmiqs, our users, or others — including fraud
      prevention and security.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <hr class="my-6 border-gray-200" />

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium text-tech">7. Data retention</h2>

  <p>
    We retain personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described
    in this policy, including to satisfy legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. Retention
    periods vary by data category and the nature of the service provided.
  </p>

  <hr class="my-6 border-gray-200" />

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium text-tech">8. Security measures</h2>

  <p>
    We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect personal
    information, including TLS/HTTPS encryption for data in transit and secure storage practices for
    data at rest.
  </p>

  <p>
    Despite our efforts, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure. In the unlikely event
    of a security incident affecting personal data, we will follow applicable notification
    obligations and remediate the issue promptly.
